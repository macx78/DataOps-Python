# DataOps-Python

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for efficient data management and processing. As a senior software engineer with 7+ years of experience, including skills in Python, these scripts are designed to streamline various data-related tasks.

## Work Descriptions

1. **Data Extraction (WIP)**: Includes Python scripts for extracting data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, and CSV files. Utilizes libraries like Pandas and Requests for seamless data retrieval.

2. **Data Transformation (WIP)**: Demonstrates data transformation scripts that clean, preprocess, and format data for analysis. Leverages Pandas for data manipulation tasks.

3. **Data Analysis (WIP)**: Features scripts for performing data analysis and generating meaningful insights. Utilizes Python's data analysis ecosystem, including NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

4. **Data Visualization (WIP)**: Provides Python scripts for creating interactive data visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly. Enhance your data storytelling capabilities.

5. **Data Automation (WIP)**: Shows how to automate repetitive data tasks using Python scripts and scheduling tools like cron. Achieve data pipeline automation for increased productivity.

6. **Data Copy**: Takes in source and target mongodb of which a given collections of "mongo collections" will be copied to the target mongodb,

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these scripts in your data-related projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy data managing!
